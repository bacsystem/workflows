# cys:ship

A Claude Code skill that takes changes from the working tree to a pull request,
following consistent conventions: branch naming, code review, Conventional
Commits, automatic SemVer, and a PR template. It is **guided, not blind** — it
pauses for your confirmation at the review, doc-update, and PR steps.

Part of the [cys plugin](../../README.md): the last stage of the flow
design → plan → run → check → **ship**. Migrated from the author's standalone
git-flow skill; behavior is unchanged.

## How to use it

There are three ways to trigger the skill:

**1. Explicit slash command** — most direct:

```
/cys:ship
```

**2. Natural language** — Claude activates it from the skill description:

```
ship this
commit and open a PR
create the PR for these changes
I'm done with this fix, take it from here
```

**3. By context** — after finishing a feature or fix, just ask Claude to wrap up
the work and it will pick up the workflow (branch → review → commit → version →
PR), pausing for your confirmation at the review, doc-update, and PR steps.

> Prerequisite for the PR step: `gh` installed and authenticated
> (`gh auth status`). Without it, the skill prints the PR body and a compare URL
> instead of creating the PR.

## What it does

1. **Detect context** — changes, version files, push remote, `gh` auth.
2. **Classify** — one Conventional Commit type + SemVer bump.
3. **Create branch** — `type/description` (e.g. `feat/login-form`).
4. **Code review** — bugs, conventions, simplifications.
5. **Verify** — run the project's test/lint command; stop if it fails.
6. **Compute version** — per source precedence, apply the bump.
7. **Update docs** — CHANGELOG, version files, README (shown before staging).
8. **Stage & commit** — Conventional Commit message in English.
9. **Push & PR** — builds the body from the template, asks before creating.
10. **Tag after merge** — `vX.Y.Z` on `main`.

## Conventions

| Aspect | Rule |
|---|---|
| Branch | `type/description`, kebab-case |
| Commit | [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), in English |
| SemVer | `feat` → minor · `fix` → patch · `BREAKING CHANGE` → major |
| Version source | `package.json` → `VERSION` → `git tag` → `CHANGELOG.md` |
| PR | Via `gh`, asks before creating |
